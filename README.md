# Dye-Sensitized-Solar-Cell-
Built a Quantum Dye Sensitized Solar Cell from scratch 
DSSCs are game-changers in the industry, harnessing sunlight through a multilevel process. DSSCs works on the principle of using plant dye as photosensitizers🍀 and absorbing the photons to release energy. Our project used TiO2, ITO coated glass, pomegranate dye and other chemicals to synthesize the solar cell, exploring its potential applications. 🍃🔍 We conducted in-depth studies, analyzing the impact of light intensity and variations in output with different dimensions of the solar cell. 📊📏 The journey was enlightening, providing us with invaluable insights into solar cell fabrication and the meticulous details involved. ☀️🔍 Grateful for the learning experience with my amazing team! 🚀
